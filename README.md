# AIP_MEPS
Code for generating custom isosurface MEPS cube files for the calculation of AIPs.

Author: Katarzyna Zator

#### Environment setup.
The script can be installed in python >3.7.11

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/k-zator/AIP_MEPS.git
    cd AIP_MEPS

Then install this environment:

        conda env create -f environment.yml
        conda activate aip_map

#### Calculation.

The code is written as an executable script with one variable which specifies the molecule file 
for which to calculate the MEPS isosurfaces. For instance, for water:

        python calculate_MEPS water.xyz

the script runs a DFT (B3LYP/6-31G*) single point calculation, then extracts electron density, MEPS 
and the specific isosurfaces (0.0020, 0.0300, 0.0104) - those have the format {name}_{isosurface}.cube, (e.g. water_0.0020.cube). Do note, though the extension specifies "cube", those are not equivalent to the Gaussian cube files. 
The files can then be used by the AIP module (https://github.com/k-zator/AIP) to calculate AIPs and then examine their interactions using AIP_map module (https://github.com/k-zator/AIP_map).
